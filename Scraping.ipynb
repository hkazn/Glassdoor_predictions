The company talks big about their values which is accurate because they do live them every day. I was one of those people that lived the values day in and day out. In fact, the values prompted me to go above and beyond what I was doing and help people around me have better experiences there. Then, I got thrust out into the world during a pandemic. I was cripplingly sad and felt betrayed. My time leading up to the layoff wasn't fantastic either. Continued mismanagement by leaders and struggling to juggle all the work I was being given, I was exhausted beyond belief but I stuck it through, because that's how much I believed in the company's mission. I trusted that the leaders knew what they were doing. I know, making the decision to lay people off isn't easy, but I refuse to believe that that was the only way out. Now, I hear news that Culture Amp is hiring again, and will quite possibly be hiring for the position I was let go from. It stings something deep.\n",

      "- The speed of change can be a challenge (I think you'd find that at most similar-sized companies).\n",
      "- Because Culture Amp leads the industry, there's a target on your back from a range of competitor products and it can be frustrating when other providers act mischievously or just have an entire strategy based on depositioning you (e.g. suggesting approaches that are not backed in science but are just different for the sake of convincing customers they should move away from CA).\n",
      "- The breadth and power of the platform does mean there's a big learning curve when starting (especially across Performance and Surveying).\n",
      "- As a VC-backed company, Culture Amp internally is cost-conscious when it comes to spending on staff outside of salaries, so there's no big Christmas bonuses, expensive lunches, or that sort of cash-splash benefits other technology companies may provide.\n",

      "- The no-commission model allows provides psychological space to deliver a better service.\n",

      "Cons\n",
      "The cons of Culture Amp are the same ones that come with any fast-growing start-up: there is always more to do than time to do it in; the company is continually outgrowing its tools and processes; and the continual need to hire more people and train them up can get in the way of the day-to-day of delivering great work. They’re good problems to have, but if a high-growth environment is a drag for you, you’ll feel that frustration here.\n",
      "Pros\n",
      "Culture Amp is a successful, fast-growing start-up with all the perks that come with that. You get to share a workplace with generally like-minded, happy, enthusiastic people working on something they care about. Moreover, unlike many tech startups, Culture Amp is building a product that makes a true positive difference in the world, and has hundreds of businesses that pay real money to use it. That is a rare combination in this industry, and I feel privileged to be a part of it.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "More than any company I’ve worked at before, Culture Amp puts time and effort into its workplace culture. You might think this is obvious, given that the company sells a people analytics platform for measuring and improving company culture, but companies don’t always practice what they preach. I’m happy to say that Culture Amp walks the walk. Some weeks, it can feel like I spend more time on initiatives to support company culture than I do on my “job”. At least four times a year everyone in the company takes an Employee Engagement survey, pores over the results, and then gets involved in initiatives to improve them. This kind of attention to company culture is exceedingly rare for a company of this size (<100 people as of this writing). If you buy into the value of these efforts, you’ll fit right in.\r\n",

It's important that employees own the conversation with their mentors (managers) to ensure they have the clarity they need to do well. In my experience, employees that don't actively drive this conversation will struggle to feel supported. \n",

This leads to a group of people that are happy, engaged in the work they're doing and overly positive and caring. You'll truly never meet a better group of people to call coworkers or feel more apart of a team in the workplace. \n",
      "\n",
      "My favorite part about Culture Amp is the genuine desire to help all employees (all levels, backgrounds, experience, etc.) learn and develop in a safe environment. The emphasis on feedback and learning faster through it (a core value) creates the ability for those that proactively take learning & development into their own hands to succeed and excel at a quick pace.\n",

As someone that's joined the team recently, the biggest challenge I've faced is learning how to communicate and make decisions in our unique culture. This is something we're constantly improving and working on, though, so I'm confidant it's more something I'm learning as I acclimatize to the culture here.\n",
      "Pros\n",
      "Culture Amp is a special place, for a whole host of reasons. The most important, is that the people here live and breath what it means to improve company culture - both for our own organization and for our clients. The people that work here all share that passion and would be doing it elsewhere if they weren't here. That makes a big difference. Culture Amp is growing quickly, has a great team of founders and leaders and a community of customers that love (and recommend) the product. \n",
      "\n",
      "A note on work/life balance. It's a busy time, but everyone is very flexible. I've felt that Culture Amp is a place that I can successfully be who I need to be, to help the company thrive. As the father of two young children, I've felt very supported by that.\n",

      "\n",
      "1) HQ is in Melbourne, so being a remote employee can be hard if you need technical support. Hopefully hiring some tech support in SF/NYC will help.\n",
      "2) work/life balance can be challenging if you don't set personal boundaries. Nobody is pressuring you to work a ton of hours or anything, but massive growth tends to make people work a lot.\n",
      "Pros\n",
      "I've read so many Glassdoor reviews that go \"this place started out so great, but then it grew and lost it's great culture.\" At Culture Amp, I get to work with these companies and learn how to prevent that from happening! And of course, I also get to work with the companies that are doing it right. \n",
      "\n",
      "As of now (end of 2015), the future of Culture Amp is really bright; great team, product, and customers. Since we help companies with HR analytics and culture, we hold ourselves to a really high standard when it comes to our own practices. Every employee has access to a professional coach (a manager coach, life/growth coach, etc) - a real commitment to the employees. Of course, there are bumps and growing pains in a fast growth start up, but we discuss and resolve these issues in the open. In my 8 months, haven't noticed any politics/bureaucracy.\n",

      "Working at Culture Amp has given me the opportunity to connect with hundreds of the world's most innovative organization's & HR leaders around the world. The impact that this company is having on the People Profession is fundamentally changing what it means to work in this space, which means not only is Culture Amp an exciting place to develop your own skills, it's also an amazing feeling to shift the needle for the HR Profession.\n",

      "Headline\n",
      "Things have changed\n",
      "Cons\n",
      "Over the past year, things have seriously changed. Culture is no longer the main focus, and management seems to lord over everyone with numbers and quota. Obviously, this is how companies stay in business, so I understand the intent, but the way they've begun to treat employees is unfortunate at best. I've also recently come to learn that they paid me far less than my male counterparts, which came as a real shock, considering the values they claim to have.\n",
      "Pros\n",
      "When I first started at Culture Amp, the main focus was on culture and it was obvious in the product and how employees were treated. It really was an amazing place to work.

      "\n",
      "Another special thing about Culture Amp is that we are in the business of employee engagement, but we also practice being a Culture First company internally. This means that no topic is taboo and that we constantly take a step back to confirm we're aligned with our values.\n",

      "Pros\n",
      "The Founders and leaders really care about Campers and the People Geek community around the world.
